# SKYCAST

## Accomplishments
- Setup NPM
- Setup Bootstrap in the project
- Set up font awesome to use icons

- Signed up and got an API key from meteosource.com and used the endpoint to get the daily, hourly, and current forecast.
-  Made website fully responsive using Bootstrap rows and columns.
 - Implemented permissions to ask for the user's longitude and latitude to use in the endpoint.
- I created a scrollable list for the hourly forecast. 
- When the user hasnâ€™t given permission for their location, an alert pops up asking them to turn it on and giving them the steps to do it.
- On the cities page, I have added a search bar and using the user input, I use that in the endpoint to execute the request and show  a list of cities
- Integrated dark mode to toggle between different themes.
- Added accessibility, for example, by adding an alt tag to the image and explaining what the image is, using an aria-label.
- When the website is in tablet and desktop mode, it gets converted into a two-column layout 
- Added spinner to indicate that the API data is loading
- Used the Google Place API to create a map, which uses a marker to show the user's location and the weather forecast.
- Used Chart.js to display API data in a line chart

 ## Challenges

- One challenge was at the beginning I was struggling to get the precise location of where the user was. I overcame this challenge by thinking about ways to store the location, and I used locale storage to solve this problem.
I struggled with implementing chart.js. I managed to overcome this issue by reading the documentation and seeing how to properly set up the chart.

## installation

- Set up npm
- Make sure Bootstrap 5.3.2 is used
- Clone project and run on the live server extension

##  What I want to add in the future 

- In the future, I will add a login and registration system 
- I will implement a favourite feature where you can save a weather reading and you can only view the reading when you are logged in.
- I will allow the user to upload an image.
- I will add regular expressions to the login forms.
